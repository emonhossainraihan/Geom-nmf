Initially the project was to create new method for [nmf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization) incorporated with geometry of the data. But now the full focus on the manifold of the data. Check out the [column_selection](https://github.com/emonhossainraihan/Geom-nmf/tree/column_selection) branch.

Old [README](https://github.com/emonhossainraihan/Geom-nmf/blob/main/old.README.md), in you interested to know what's the plan for the nmf.
